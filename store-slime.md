<h2>Slime Storage</h2>
<p class="mb-3">So you made some Slime with the kids, but now they are done playing with it and you need to put it up! Most kids LOVE slime and will want to play with it every day, but you can't make a fresh batch every morning!</p>

<p class="mb-3">If you are anything like me then you are probably wondering...</p>

<p class="mb-3">How the heck to I store slime?</p>

<p class="mb-3">Listen:</p>

<p class="mb-3">Storing slime is as easy as making it! There are a few different ways to store your newly made slime, and you won't have to go to the store for any extra groceries!</p>

<p class="mb-3">At <a href="/">Sleep-Recipe.com</a> my number one recommendation is to always refrigerate your slime if you want it to last more than one day!</p>

<h2>Using Ziplock Bags</h2>  
<p class="mb=3">The quickest way to store your slime is in zip lock bags. Once you are done playing put your slime into biggies, squeeze out all the extra air and seal them tight.</p>

<p class="mb=3">While this might be the easiest way to keep slime fresh overnight it also causes a lot of waste. If you are eco-friendly and care about the enviroment it might be best to try another storage option!</p>

<h2>Using Plastic Tupperware</h2>
<p class="mb=3">Plastic tupperware is another popular storage option in my house for both food and slime! It is easy to clean and all you need to do is snap on the top and throw it into the fridge!</p> 

<p class="mb=3">Unlike plastic bags they are reusable and won't fill our landfills with trash!</p>

<h2>With Glass Jars</h2> 
<p class="mb=3">Glass mason jars are a fun option if you have them in your pantry. They will keep slime the fresh for the longest amount of time since they are the most air tight storage option!</p>

<h2>In Plastic Jars</h2> 
<p class="mb=3">Not everyone saves plastic jars, but empty peanut butter and other plastic jars can be cleaned an reused as storage. Empty plastic jars work just like Mason jars, except they are not as air tight and don't last as long.</p>



<h3>Are you supposed to refrigerate slime?</h3>
<p class="mb=3">We highly recommend storing slime in a refrigerator. Slime will be OK at room temperature for a few hours, but if you want to play it the next day it needs to be in the fridge overnight!</p>

<h3>Can you fix hard slime?</h3>
<p class="mb=3">Hard slime is not a lost cause! Most Mom's see a bag of hard slime and assume they need to make a new batch of slime.</p>
<p class="mb=3">Hard slime can actually be saved with a hair dryer, adding extra water, mixing in antibacterial handgel like Purell, or by mixing in extra Elmer's glue!</p>

<h3>How can I make slime last longer?</h3>
<p class="mb=3">Slime does not last forever, even the longest lasting slime will get hard after 4 or 5 days. To make your slime last longer try adding extra Borax or Elmer's glue when you notice your slime losing it stretchiness!</p>

<h3>How can I prevent slime from getting hard?</h3>
<p class="mb=3">Slime won't last forever, but you can extend its life with a few easy tricks. First, always make sure to store your slime in an airtight container to prevent it from getting hard.</p>
<p class="mb=3">Second, ry to prevent dirt and other small particles from building up in your slime by washing it with water if your children get it dirty!</p>

<h3>Will slime last overnight?</h3>
<p class="mb=3">Slime will last overnight, but only if kept in an airtight container in the fridge!</p>
